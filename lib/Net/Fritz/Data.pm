package Net::Fritz::Data;
# ABSTRACT: wraps various response data


use Scalar::Util qw(blessed);

use Moo;

with 'Net::Fritz::IsNoError';

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $fritz    = Net::Fritz::Box->new();
    my $device   = $fritz->discover();
    my $service  = $device->find_service('DeviceInfo:1');
    my $response = $service->call('GetSecurityPort');

    # $response is Net::Fritz::Data
    printf "SSL communication port is %d\n",
           $response->data->{NewSecurityPort};


    my $service_list = $device->find_service_names('DeviceInfo:1');

    # service_list is Net::Fritz::Data
    printf "%d services found\n",
           scalar @{$service_list->data};

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class wraps the return data from a L<Net::Fritz::Service> call.
This is only done for consistent error checks: L<Net::Fritz::Data>
does the role L<Net::Fritz::IsNoError>, so it is possible to check for
errors during the service call with C<$response-E<gt>error> and
C<$response-E<gt>errorcheck> (see L<Net::Fritz::Error> for details).

Apart from that the response data from the service call is passed
through unaltered, so you have to know with which data type the
services answers.

This wrapper class is also used in some other methods that return
things that need to be error-checkable, like
L<find_service_names|Net::Fritz::Device/find_service_names(regexp)>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES (read-only)

=head2 data

Returns the response data of the service call.  For lists and hashes,
this will be a reference.

=cut

has data => ( is => 'ro' );

=head2 error

See L<Net::Fritz::IsNoError/error>.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

Creates a new L<Net::Fritz::Data> object.  You propably don't have to
call this method, it's mostly used internally.  Expects parameters in
C<key =E<gt> value> form with the following keys:

=over

=item I<data>

set the data to hold

=back

With only one parameter (in fact: any odd value of parameters), the
first parameter is automatically mapped to I<data>.

=for Pod::Coverage BUILDARGS

=cut

# prepend 'data => ' when called without hash
# (when called with uneven list)
sub BUILDARGS {
    my ( $class, @args ) = @_;
    
    unshift @args, "data" if @args % 2 == 1;
    
    return { @args };
};

=head2 get

Kind of an alias for C<$response->data>: Returns the L<data|/data>
attribute.

=cut

sub get {
    my $self = shift;

    return $self->data;
}

=head2 dump(I<indent>)

Returns some preformatted multiline information about the object.
Useful for debugging purposes, printing or logging.  The optional
parameter I<indent> is used for indentation of the output by
prepending it to every line.

=cut

sub dump {
    my $self = shift;

    my $indent = shift;
    $indent = '' unless defined $indent;

    my $text = "${indent}" . blessed( $self ) . ":\n";
    $text .= "${indent}----data----\n";
    $text .= $self->data . "\n";
    $text .= "------------\n";

    return $text;
}

=head2 errorcheck

See L<Net::Fritz::IsNoError/errorcheck>.

=head1 SEE ALSO

See L<Net::Fritz> for general information about this package,
especially L<Net::Fritz/INTERFACE> for links to the other classes.
